# Environment

## Docker compose environment

### Start
To start Docker Compose, from `workshop/exercises`, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a Docker container with pygeoapi (reachable from the browser at [this address](http://localhost:5000/)).

To stop, use the command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
