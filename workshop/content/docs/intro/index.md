# Introduction to pygeoapi

The development team of pygeoapi is happy to welcome you on this workshop. In this 4 hour workshop we will give you an introduction to pygeoapi.
Although pygeoapi is very customisable for python developers, python skills are not required to enjoy the product and this workshop.

## pygeoapi's history

pygeoapi emerged from one of the OGC (open Geospatial Consortium) codesprints around the new generation of OGC API standards and builds on top of a set of python and geopython libraries.
