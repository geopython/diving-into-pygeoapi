through the following exercises:

- [Exercise 1 - Your first dataset](first.md)
- [Exercise 2 - Vector data via OGC API - Features](ogcapi-features.md)
- [Exercise 3 - Raster data via OGC API - Coverages](ogcapi-coverages.md)
- [Exercise 4 - Tiles of geospatial data via OGC API - Tiles](ogcapi-tiles.md)
- [Exercise 5 - Maps of geospatial data via OGC API - Maps](ogcapi-maps.md)
- [Exercise 6 - Metadata via OGC API - Records](ogcapi-records.md)
- [Exercise 7 - Environmental data via OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval](ogcapi-edr.md)
- [Exercise 8 - Functions via OGC API - Processes](ogcapi-processes.md)
- [Exercise 9 - pygeoapi as a bridge to other services](../advanced/bridges.md)
