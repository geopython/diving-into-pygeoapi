Within weeks, several talented developers joined the project, which led to the formation of a core team and Project Steering Committee (PSC). Contributions continued as well from additional developers and users who happily provided new functionality, bug fixes, and documentation updates. As a result, a healthy community quickly emerged with a common interest in open source, OGC API standards, low barrier, modular and extensible. The rest, as they say, is history.</p> <p>pygeoapi is an OSGeo Project and an OGC Reference Implementation.</p>"},{"location":"setup/","title":"Workshop environment setup","text":"<p>In this workshop we use the following materials:</p> <ol> <li>Documentation - (like this page): access latest on dive.pygeoapi.io</li> <li>Exercises - download the latest zip file, unzip, find exercises in <code>workshop/exercises</code> <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Docker - all examples/exercises are run in a <code>Docker container</code> in <code>workshop/exercises</code></li> </ol>"},{"location":"setup/#text-editor","title":"Text editor","text":"<p>Your text editor needs to be able to edit configuration files in plain text.

If you are not familiar with YAML, it is worth reading through a tutorial to become aware of YAML syntax and indentation.</p> <p>The main requirement for the training is to install Docker and/with Docker Compose on your system. We strongly advise to install Docker before the workshop starts.</p> <p>Although several custom installation scenarios are possible (see the documentation for more information), these are not considered in this workshop given the ability to install a fully reproducible environment via Docker and Docker Compose.</p> <p>Workshop Exercises will also be based on Docker, hence a custom installation would at least be 'challenging'.

Given the current era of computing, chances are that you have heard of Docker and containerization. Or, perhaps are already familiar and hopefully using Docker already. If not, there is an abundance of introductory materials that can be found online like this tutorial from IBM.</p> <p>FOSS4G software has benefitted greatly from Docker (consistent packaging, isolation, integration and upgrade patterns) in comparison to custom installations. Though today we mainly use Docker, the bigger picture is the use of Containers as a next step in virtualization. Containerization certainly deserves its own workshop, so for the purpose of this workshop we only cover the basics of Docker and Docker Compose.</p> <p>Docker Compose is an addition to Docker to facilitate the orchestration (configuration) of one or more Docker 'Containers' (a Container is a running instance of a Docker image) using a configuration convention (the Docker Compose YAML file), usually named <code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</p> <p>Stepping up further are even more sophisticated Docker orchestrators like  Rancher and Kubernetes, but for this workshop, Docker and Docker Compose are all we need.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Docker installation has greatly progressed over the years. This is the only part of the workshop which is dependent on the system/OS you are running (e.g. Windows, Mac or Linux). For each system the Docker website provides detailed installation instructions. Please follow these consistently.</p> <p>For many platforms a product called Docker Desktop is available, which includes the main Docker components:</p> <ul> <li>Windows installation</li> <li>Mac installation</li> <li>Linux installation</li> </ul> <p>Some notes:</p> <ul> <li>On Windows we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as it also provides a powerful (Bash) command line and has optimal integration with Docker.  Before installing Docker Desktop, install WSL by opening Microsoft PowerShell (run as administrator) and running <code>wsl --install</code><ul> <li>installing WSL requires administrator privileges on your system</li> </ul> </li> <li>On Mac, if you are using Homebrew, consider (as the author has) using the brew Docker formula</li> <li>On Mac OSX Monterey and later, there may be an issue with local port 5000 already in use, therefore conflicting with the default one used by the pygeoapi container. If you see this error <code>OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use</code>, you need to disable the Airplay Receiver. Go to <code>System Settings | Sharing</code> or like in Sonoma type 'airplay' in the search box. See image below for Mac OSX Sonoma. Also a detailed description in this blog post. </li> <li>On Linux, you can choose the relevant installer for your platform. You can also use Virtualbox with a Ubuntu Image or use a cloud VM</li> <li>On Linux, when encountering permission issues: the Docker daemon normally runs as \"root\". This requires prefixing commands with <code>sudo</code> as a non-root user. On most distributions Docker is accessible by users in the <code>docker</code> group. You can omit the use of <code>sudo</code> and prevent possibly other permission issues as follows:<ul> <li>Test if the <code>docker</code> group exists: <code>cat /etc/group | grep docker</code>.</li> <li>When non-existing: <code>sudo groupadd docker</code>. </li> <li>Add your user to this group: <code>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</code> </li> <li>Log-out and log-in.</li> <li>See all details and more options in this instruction.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Docker Desktop includes a graphical user interface with some interesting options. You can see logs and information about running containers, open their service in a browser or even open a terminal inside the container</li> </ul> <p>If all goes well, you should be able to run Docker from the command line as follows: <sup>2</sup></p> Linux/MacWindows (PowerShell) <p> <pre><code>docker version\nDocker version 20.10.17, build 100c701\n\ndocker compose version\nDocker Compose version v2.6.1\n</code></pre> </p> <p> <pre><code>docker version\nDocker version 20.10.17, build 100c701\n\ndocker compose version\nDocker Compose version v2.6.1\n</code></pre> </p> <p>(It is not required that your version numbers exactly match).</p>"},{"location":"setup/#quickstart","title":"Quickstart","text":"<p>Once Docker is available on your system, running the pygeoapi container with its built-in configuration and  data is a one-liner. </p> <p>Open a terminal session and run:</p> <p>First run via Docker</p> Linux/MacWindows (PowerShell) <p> <pre><code>docker run --rm -p 5000:80 geopython/pygeoapi:latest\nUnable to find image 'geopython/pygeoapi:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from geopython/pygeoapi\nd7bfe07ed847: Already exists \nd5d0144a7164: Already exists \nafe0923a0fa0: Already exists \n75f8618c4e86: Already exists \nc603397fd6ad: Already exists \n6584a95328b3: Already exists \nfd93e44631d9: Already exists \n6a3201071a5d: Already exists \n4f4fb700ef54: Already exists \nDigest: sha256:27b2b219497a6ea382a946ee90ae96ad00b5c1d8e9b725fccf23211978fef124\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for geopython/pygeoapi:latest\nSTART /entrypoint.sh\nTrying to generate openapi.yml\nopenapi.yml generated continue to pygeoapi\nmake SCRIPT_NAME empty from /\nStart gunicorn name=pygeoapi on 0.0.0.0:80 with 4 workers and SCRIPT_NAME=\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80 (1)\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: gevent\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [18] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 18\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [19] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [21] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 21\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22\n</code></pre> </p> <p> <pre><code>docker run --rm -p 5000:80 geopython/pygeoapi:latest\nUnable to find image 'geopython/pygeoapi:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from geopython/pygeoapi\nd7bfe07ed847: Already exists \nd5d0144a7164: Already exists \nafe0923a0fa0: Already exists \n75f8618c4e86: Already exists \nc603397fd6ad: Already exists \n6584a95328b3: Already exists \nfd93e44631d9: Already exists \n6a3201071a5d: Already exists \n4f4fb700ef54: Already exists \nDigest: sha256:27b2b219497a6ea382a946ee90ae96ad00b5c1d8e9b725fccf23211978fef124\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for geopython/pygeoapi:latest\nSTART /entrypoint.sh\nTrying to generate openapi.yml\nopenapi.yml generated continue to pygeoapi\nmake SCRIPT_NAME empty from /\nStart gunicorn name=pygeoapi on 0.0.0.0:80 with 4 workers and SCRIPT_NAME=\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80 (1)\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: gevent\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [18] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 18\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [19] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [21] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 21\n[2022-08-09 12:59:00 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22\n</code></pre> </p> <p>That's all!
